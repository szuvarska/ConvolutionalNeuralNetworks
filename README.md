This repository contains the three projects from the Deep Learning course in the Data Science Master's program at the Faculty of Mathematics and Information Science. In these projects, we:

1. Implement and thoroughly test **convolutional neural networks** (CNNs) to classify objects in images.
2. Develop a solution using **transformer** architecture to recognize voice commands.
3. Train various **generative models** to create pictures of cats.

The goal of this work is purely educational and research-focused. We aim not to create the best possible models, but to learn as much as possible.
