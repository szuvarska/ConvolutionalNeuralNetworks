# ConvolutionalNeuralNetworks

This is the repository for the first project in the Deep Learning course in Data Science Masters at the Faculty of Mathematics and Information Science. Here we learn convolutional neural networks (CNN) and on top of it we try to develop intuitions. We were informed that this work's goal is purely educational and research-focused, so we aim not to create the best recognition model but to learn as much as possible.

## Future Work

* how do the distributions on given outputs look like (correct classification, bad classification, bad classification - one class)? Is the model sure or unsure? Can we return the label "unsure", pass noise to the model and see how confident it is in prediction (in theory it should be very confident on noise)
* create a marimo notebook where you show the augmentation techniques
* how does sota model performs, how does our model performs on correct and incorrectly classified samples from sota model, check incorrectly classified samples maybe they are miss labeled
