This is the repository for the three projects in the Deep Learning course in Data Science Masters at the Faculty of Mathematics and Information Science. Here we:

1. implement and thourly test convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify objects at image
2. create a solution using transformers architecture to recognize voice commands
3. train various gerative models to create pictures of cats

This work's goal is purely educational and research-focused. We aim not to create the best possible models  but to learn as much as possible.
